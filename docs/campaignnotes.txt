The Demonic Invasion

News arrives in Gulutheim that the blockade of Marinda has been broken when damaged Morrind warships limp into port.

Sanguine wants Rukn to kill a messenger headed inland bringing news of the impending demonic invasion.

Beer in the inn is among the best Ralf ever tasted, made by the local chapter of the Morrind Brewers Club.

Ralf wakes up next to a grumpy old sailor in the inn.  Next time he sleeps Nera is angry that he escaped the desert
through the actions of another divine.  Grants the boon of knowledge, being the location of Galen, somewhere on
the island of Marinda.
