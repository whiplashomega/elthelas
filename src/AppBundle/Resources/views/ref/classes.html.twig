    <p>For a detailed description of the Barbarian class see the Player's Handbook (p46-50)</p>
    <h3>Primal Path</h3>

    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>
      You may also ask your DM to consider the following changes to the Barbarian's class features for balance reasons:
    </p>
    <h4>Rage</h4>
    <p>
      In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
      you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
      aren’t wearing heavy armor:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
        saving throws.</li>
      <li>
        When you make a melee weapon attack using
        Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
        increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, <strike>as shown
        in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</strike>
        <strong>Equal to 2 times your proficiency bonus.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
        slashing damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
      concentrate on them while raging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
      knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
      haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
      or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
      on your turn as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have raged the number of times shown
      for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
      Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
      can rage again.

    <h3>Martial Archetypes</h3>
    <p>Fighters have the following Martial Archetypes available to them: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Battle Master (PHB p73-74)</li>
      <li>Champion (PHB p72-73)</li>
      <li>Eldritch Knight (PHB p74-75)</li>
      <li>Knight of the Realm (see Purple Dragon Knight SCAG p128)</li>
      <li>Scourer (see below)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scourer</h3>
    <h4>Slay Magic</h4>
    <p>
      At third level when you take this Martial Archetype your skills reveal weak spots in spell casters that others miss. Gain an extra 1d8 damage against an enemy that you have seen casting a
      spell within the last minute. This damage increases to 2d8 at level 18.
    </p>
    <h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
    <p>
      You gain proficiency in the arcana skill.
    </p>
    <h4>Capture Magic</h4>
    <p>
      At level 7 you have learned how spell casters create and spin their magical effects, and have learned how to prevent it. When you successfully
      grapple a creature, the target becomes unable to cast spells that have verbal or semantic components as long as they are grappled.
    </p>
    <h4>Counter Magic</h4>
    <p>
      At level 10 you have learned the inner working of spells and can inherently use the spell against itself. Twice per short rest, you can bend another’s
      spell to your will.  To do this you must spend your reaction to negate or control another casters spell. 3rd level or lower spells are automatically affected while higher level spells 
      require a charisma check with the DC being 10 + the spells level. If you succeed, you can choose to negate the spell entirely, or
      if the spell targets a single target other than the caster, you can choose a different target for the spell. If the spell is a concentration spell,
      you take over concentration for the spells duration if you choose to do so. You may only concentrate on one spell at a time. 
    </p>
    <h4>See Magic</h4>
    <p>
      At level 15, you have learned to see past the trickery magic can create. You have advantage on wisdom saves against spells and advantage on detecting
      illusions. 
    </p>    
  </div>
  <div class="racediv" id="factotum">
    
    <h2>Factotum</h2>
    <p>
      The Factotum is a homebrewed class loosely based on the similarly named class from D&D 3.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Factotum is the ultimate seeker of knowledge.  A student of
      all schools, the Factotum seeks any kind of knowledge, and uses everything
      she learns to her advantage.  Her constant study allows the Factotum to
      display flashes of inspiration, filling any role necessary, if only for
      a short time.  The Factotum is nothing if not versatile, although
      occasionally unfocused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, the Factotum is prepared for anything, any circumstance and any challenge, at least when
      they manage to make it out of the library.  While the Factotum's focus on learning new things is
      similar to the wizard's focus on arcane knowledge, the Factotum does not share the Wizard's focus.
      The Factotum is just as interested in that tome on arcane combat styles, or the architects detailed
      schematics as that previously unknown spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Factotum's as civilians often work as librarians, scientists, or advisors to people of power.  As adventurers
      they travel the world seeking out stores of hidden knowledge, documenting unusual creatures, learning from reclusive
      masters of various arts and skills, or just meeting unusual people, enjoying foods they could never experience at home,
      and seeing the sights.  In all of their doings they have a talent for coming up with the solution no one else thought of,
      and with a flash of inspiration, snatching victory and success from the jaws of failure and defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans and half-elves are the most common factotums, followed by halflings
      and gnomes.

    <h3>Class Features</h3>
    <h4>Inspiration</h4>
    <p>
      The Factotum gets a number of inspiration points that they can spend to
      activate certain class features.  They get inspiration points equal to
      their intelligence modifier plus half their class level (rounded down),
      minimum 1.  They recover all of their inspiration points when they
      finish a short rest.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Skills</h4>
    <p>
      You can spend an inspiration point when making any skill check to add
      your intelligence bonus to the check.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 1st level, you can spend inspiration points to cast
      spells.  You know cantrips and spells according to the factotum
      table, and can learn any spell from any classes spell list as long as
      you are able to learn spells of that level.  Intelligence is your
      spellcasting ability for these spells.  You can cast a cantrip as long as
      you have an inspiration point to spend on it, and a spell of a higher
      level as long as you have sufficient inspiration points to cast it,
      and a spell slot remaining.  Casting a spell costs a number of
      inspiration points equal to 1 + the spells level.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Attack</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, you can spend an inspiration point before
      making an attack roll to add your intelligence bonus to the attack
      roll.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Damage</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action you can spend an inspiration
      point to add 1d8 to any weapon or spell damage roll you make until
      the start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Factotum Philosophy</h4
    <p>
      At 3rd level your studies begin to focus on a particular specialty.
      Choose one of the Factotum Philosophies below, you gain different
      abilities depending on which philosophy you choose.  You gain
      additional philosophy features at 10th and 17th level.
    </p>
    <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
    <p>
      At 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you gain a +2 bonus to one ability score, +1 to two ability scores, or a feat.
    </p>
    <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
    <p>
      At 5th level you can make 2 attacks when you take the attack action on your turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Action</h4>
    <p>
      At 11th level, On your turn you can spend 3 inspiration points to get
      an extra action.  You can only do this once per long rest.
    </p>
    <h4>Improved Inspired Damage</h4>
    <p>
      At 13th level, when you use the inspired damage feature you add 2d8 to
      your damage rolls.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Reaction</h4>
    <p>
      At 14th level, when you have the opportunity to react to an action but
      have already reacted that turn you can spend 2 inspiration points to
      react a second time.  After you do this you cannot use this feature or
      the inspired action feature until the end of your next turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Inspired Recovery</h4>
    <p>
      At 20th level you no longer require a short rest to regain your
      inspiration points, but can do so by spending 10 minutes reading and
      studying your books and materials.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Factotum Philosophies</h3>
    
    
    <h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>
    
    
    <p>
      Those who follow the Brains over Brawn philosophy have focused their studies on the weaknesses
      of their potential enemies, taking the idea of knowledge as power into the field of combat. These
      scholars always seem to know their enemies weaknesses, and can use that knowledge to get around
      their defenses.
    </p>
    <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can spend a bonus action to study an
      opponent and discover how to get past its defenses.   When you use
      this ability pick a target, you can use your intelligence modifier
      instead of strength or dexterity on weapon attack rolls and damage
      rolls until the start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, your knowledge of your opponents weaknesses allows you to strike with
      uncanny precision if you catch them off guard.  Once per round, when you successfully hit an opponent with an attack and that enemy
      is adjacent to an ally or you have advantage against them, you can
      spend 1 inspiration point to add 2d6 damage to the attack roll, this increases to 3d6 at 11th level,
      4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.
    </p>
    <h4>Fighting Style Mimic</h4>
    <p>
      At 10th level the Brains over Brawn Factotum can pick one of the following fighting styles.  Whenever they finish a long rest they can
      spend 3 inspiration points to replace this fighting style with a different one from the list.  This ability does not stack with the fighting
      style granted by any other class.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archery</strong> - You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
      <li><strong>Dueling</strong> - When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
          with that weapon.</li>
      <li><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage
          of the second attack.</li>
      <li><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
          make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
          roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
          this benefit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Improved Inspired Attack</h4>
    <p>
      At 15th level, when you use an inspiration point to add a bonus to
      your attack roll, you can make an additional attack as a bonus action,
      adding your intelligence modifier to both attacks.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Arcane Dilettante</h3>
    
    
    <p>
      The Arcane Dilettante has studied magic enough that they begin to seem less like
      their faking it, and more like a practiced wizard.  They no longer rely on bursts
      of inspiration for their most practiced spells, and can put together an idea of
      how to cast even unpracticed spells with less effort.
    </p>
    <h4>Improved Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, the number of inspiration points you need to cast a
      spell is reduced by one, to a minimum of 0 for cantrips.  Also you can
      cast an additional 2 spells per day (in addition to the amount listed
      in the Factotum table) before requiring a long rest, and can cast higher level spells, use the table below instead of the Factotum table to determine
      the highest level of spell you can cast and your spells known.

    <h4>Additional Skill Proficiency</h4>
    <p>
      At 3rd level the arcane dilettante gains proficiency in the arcana skill.  If they were already proficient in the
      arcana skill they gain expertise in the arcana skill (can add their proficiency bonus twice).
    </p>
    <h4>Spell Study</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level you have become a proficient enough spell
      caster that you can make a spell work with only minimal study.
      Starting when they gain this feature, the Factotum can add any spell
      they successfully observe being cast to a spell journal.  In order to successfully add it to their spell journal the following conditions
      must be met:
      <ul>
        <li>The spell must be of a level the Factotum can cast.</li>
        <li>
          The Factotum must be able to see (if it has somatic/material components) and hear (if it has a verbal component)
          the spell being cast.
        </li>
        <li>
          They then must succeed on an intelligence (arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + the spells level at the time the spell is cast.
          If they fail this check they can try again only if they observe the spell being cast again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>    
        The Factotum can, in addition to their normal spells known, prepare 1 spell from their spell journal.  Whenever you regain your spent
        inspiration points you can change what spell you have prepared.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h4>Cantrip Master</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, whenever The Factotum finishes a long rest they can trade out one cantrip you know for a different cantrip that they have
      successfully recorded to their spell journal.
    </p>
    <h4>Sage</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 15th level you regain your spells per day after a short rest
      instead of a long rest.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>The Skill Monkey</h3>
    
    
    <p> The Skill Monkey has made it their mission to master every skill, taking the Factotum's philosophy of prepared for anything.</p>
    <h4>Jack-of-all-Trades</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can add half your proficiency
      bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that
      doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.
    </p>
  
    <h4>Improved Inspired Skills</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 7th level, when the Skill Monkey uses the inspire skill ability they add their proficiency bonus as well as their intelligence modifier
      to the check, even if they are already proficient in that skill.
    </p>
    <h4>Expertise</h4>
    <p>
      At 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
      proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
      make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
    </p>
    <h4>Reliable Talent</h4>
    <p>
      By 15th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
      they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
      check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
      treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

    <p>
      You may also ask your DM to consider the following changes to the Ranger's class features for balance reasons:
    </p>
    <p>Changes are <strong>In Bold</strong></p>
    <h4>Favored Enemy</h4>
    <p>
      Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience
      studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain
      type of enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations,
      beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey,
      fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
      Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid
      (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to
      track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence
      checks to recall information about them.
    </p>
    <p><strong>
      When you hit one of your favored enemies with a weapon attack you do
      additional damage equal to your wisdom modifier.
    </strong></p>
    <p>
      When you gain this feature, you also learn one
      language of your choice that is spoken by your favored
      enemies, if they speak one at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as
      an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you
      gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
      monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
    </p>
  
    <h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating
      camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh
      mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring
      materials with which to create your camouflage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
      to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface,
      such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide
      as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)
      checks.  <strike>as long as you remain there without moving or
      taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a
      reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain
      this benefit.</strike><strong>Once you move more than 100 ft. from your original location,
      or the terrain you are in changes you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</strong>
    </p>
    <h4>Foe Slayer</h4>
    <p>
      At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
      enemies. <strike>Once on each of your turns, you can add your
      Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
      an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.</strike>
      <strong>When you attack your favored enemy you can add your proficiency bonus to all weapon damage rolls
      against your favored enemy, and your wisdom bonus to your attack rolls.</strong>
      You can choose to use this feature before or after the
      roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
    </p>
    <h4>Ranger's Companion</h4>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that
      accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to
      fight alongside you. Choose a beast that <strike>is no larger than
      Medium and that</strike> has a challenge rating of <strong>1/2 or your ranger level divided by 6, rounded down</strong> or lower
      (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff,
      and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus
      to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skills it is proficient in.
      <strong>For saving throws it uses its own bonus or your bonus, whichever is greater</strong>.
      Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or <strong>six
      times your ranger level</strong>, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It
      takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an
      action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can
      verbally command the beast where to move (no action
      required by you). You can use your <strong>bonus action</strong> to verbally
      command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,
      or Help action. <strike>Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
      you can make one weapon attack yourself when you
      command the beast to take the Attack action.</strike>
    </p>
    <p>
      While traveling through your favored terrain with only
      the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by
      spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast
      that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type o f beast as
      before or a different one.

    <h2>Sorcerer</h2>
    <p>For a detailed description of the Sorcerer class see the Player's Handbook (p99-104)</p>
    <h3>Sorcerous Origins</h3>
    <p>Sorcerers have the following Sorcerous Origins available to them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Draconic Bloodline (PHB p102-103)</li>
      <li>Wild Magic (PHB p103-104)</li>
      <li>Sorceron Bloodline (homebrew)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sorceron Bloodline</h3>
    <p>
      The descendents of the Sorceron often show the physical traits of their ancient magical celestial ancestors
      (see the Sorceron Blooded Aasimar subrace), however some appear to show the physical characteristics of
      their other family.  Nevertheless many of them have one thing in common, blood naturally infused with
      Arcanum crystal, and the resulting affinity for sorcerous magic.  Granted many of them do not pursue this path,
      using their magical abilities rarely if at all, and thus not developing in the sorcerer class, but those
      that do can choose the Sorceron Bloodline for their Sorcerous Origin.
    </p>
    <h4>Force Affinity</h4>
    <p>
      At 1st level, the blood of the Sorceron gives the Sorceron blooded a special affinity for spells that manipulate pure
      magical force.  They learn the magic missile, mage armor, and shield spells in addition to their normal spells known.
    </p>
    <h4>Enhanced Force Spells</h4>
    <p>
      When the Sorceron Blooded casts the magic missile spell, each missile does 1d4 + 2 in damage instead of its normal damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Sorceron Blooded casts the Mage Armor spell it has a duration of 16 hours instead of the typical 8 hours.
    </p>
    <h4>Spontaneous Recovery</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at 6th level, whenever the Sorceron Blooded casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20, on a 20 the spell slot is not expended
      when the spell is cast.  Starting at 18th level the spell slot is not expended when the Sorceron Blooded rolls a 19 or a 20 on the d20 roll.
    </p>
    <h4>Godly Servant</h4>
    <p>
      At 14th level your connection to your Sorceron ancestor has improved such that you begin to feel the power of their connection to the divine.
      Pick one divine domain, add the spells from that domains domain spell list to your list of spells known, you can cast these spells as if they
      were sorcerer spells of the appropriate level.
