  <h2>Factotum</h2>
  <p>
    The Factotum is the ultimate 'Jack-of-all-Trades'.  A student of
    all schools, the Factotum seeks any kind of knowledge, and uses everything
    she learns to her advantage.  Her constant study allows the Factotum to
    display flashes of inspiration, filling any role necessary, if only for
    a short time.  The Factotum is nothing if not versatile, although
    occasionally unfocused.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans and half-elves are the most common factotums, followed by halflings
    and gnomes.

    minimum 1.  They recover all of their inspiration points when they
    finish a short rest.

    table, and can learn any spell from any classes spell list as long as
    you are able to learn spells of that level.  Intelligence is your
    spellcasting stat for these spells.  You can cast a cantrip as long as
    you have an inspiration point to spend on it, and a spell of a higher
    level as long as you have sufficient inspiration points to cast it,
    and a spell slot remaining.  Casting a spell costs a number of
    inspiration points equal to 1 + the spells level.

    point you spend you can heal 1d8 hit points.
  </p>

  </p>
  <h2>Factotum Philosophies</h2>
  <h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>
  <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 5th level, you can spend a bonus action to study an
    opponent and discover how to get past its defenses.   When you use
    this ability pick a target, you can use your intelligence modifier
    instead of strength or dexterity on weapon attack rolls and damage
    rolls until the start of your next turn.  Additionally, once per
    round if you hit your target with a weapon attack on your turn you
    can immediately make a second attack with the same weapon against the
    same opponent.
  </p>
  <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Your knowledge of your opponents weaknesses allows you to strike with
    uncanny precision if you catch them off guard.  Whenever you use your
    Know Your Enemy feature, and you have advantage on the attack roll or
    the opponent is adjacent to one of your allies, you can add
    2d6 damage to the attack roll, this increases to 3d6 at 14th level,
    and 4d6 at 18th level.  You can only add this bonus damage once per
    round, no matter how many attacks you make.

    adding your intelligence modifier to both attacks.
  </p>

    spell is reduced by one, to a minimum of 0 for cantrips.  Also you can
    cast an additional 2 spells per day (in addition to the amount listed
    in the Factotum table) before requiring a long rest.  Finally the
    highest level of spell you can cast increases by 1 over that listed in
    the Factotum table.
  </p>
  <h4>Spell Study</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level you have become a proficient enough spell
    caster that you can make a spell work with only minimal study.  You
    may prepare two spells of a level you can cast in addition to your
    normal spells known.  Whenever you regain your spent inspiration
    points you can change what spells you have prepared.
  </p>
  <h4>Sage</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 17th level you regain your spells per day after short rest
    instead of a long rest.  Also the highest level of spell you can learn
    and cast increases by an additional 1 level over that listed in the
    Factotum table (combined with the additional level from Improved
    Inspired Spellcasting, your maximum spell level increases by 2, to 7).
