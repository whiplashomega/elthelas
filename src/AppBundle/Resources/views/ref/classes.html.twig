  <h2>Factotum</h2>
  <p>
    The Factotum is the ultimate 'Jack-of-all-Trades'.  A student of
    all schools, the Factotum seeks any kind of knowledge, and uses everything
    she learns to her advantage.  Her constant study allows the Factotum to
    display flashes of inspiration, filling any role necessary, if only for
    a short time.  The Factotum is nothing if not versatile, although
    occasionally unfocused.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans and half-elves are the most common factotums, followed by halflings
    and gnomes.

  <h3>Class Features</h3>
  <h4>Inspiration</h4>
  <p>
    The Factotum gets a number of inspiration points that they can spend to
    activate certain class features.  They get inspiration points equal to
    their intelligence modifier plus half their class level(rounded down),
    minimum 1.  They recover all of their inspiration points when they
    finish a short rest.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Skills</h4>
  <p>
    You can spend an inspiration point when making any skill check to add
    your intelligence bonus to the check.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 2nd level, you can spend an inspiration point before
    making an attack roll to add your intelligence bonus to the attack
    roll.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Damage</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action you can spend an inspiration
    point to add 1d8 to any weapon or spell damage roll you make until
    the start of your next turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can spend inspiration points to cast
    spells.  You know cantrips and spells according to the factotum
    table, and can learn any spell from any classes spell list as long as
    you are able to learn spells of that level.  Intelligence is your
    spellcasting stat for these spells.  You can cast a cantrip as long as
    you have an inspiration point to spend on it, and a spell of a higher
    level as long as you have sufficient inspiration points to cast it,
    and a spell slot remaining.  Casting a spell costs a number of
    inspiration points equal to 1 + the spells level.
  </p>
  <h4>Factotum Philosophy</h4
  <p>
    At 5th level your studies begin to focus on a particular specialty.
    Choose one of the Factotum Philosophies below, you gain different
    abilities depending on which philosophy you choose.  You gain
    additional philosophy features at 10th and 17th level.
  </p>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Skills</h4>

    check you add your intelligence modifier plus your proficiency bonus
    to the skill check.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Healer</h4>
  <p>
    At 7th level, you can use an action to spend any number of inspiration
    points in order to heal one person you touch.  For each inspiration
    point you spend you can heal 1d8 hit points.
  </p>
  <h4>Practiced Caster</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 9th level, pick one cantrip that you know.  You can cast
    this cantrip without using an inspiration point.  You can change which
    cantrip you can cast in this way after a long rest.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Action</h4>

    At 14th level, when you have the opportunity to react to an action but
    have already reacted that turn you can spend 2 inspiration points to

    studying your books and materials.
  </p>
  <h2>Factotum Philosophies</h2>
  <h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>
  <p>
    Those who follow the Brains over Brawn philosophy have focused their studies on the weaknesses
    of their potential enemies, taking the idea of knowledge as power into the field of combat. These
    scholars always seem to know their enemies weaknesses, and can use that knowledge to get around
    their defenses.
  </p>
  <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 5th level, you can spend a bonus action to study an
    opponent and discover how to get past its defenses.   When you use
    this ability pick a target, you can use your intelligence modifier
    instead of strength or dexterity on weapon attack rolls and damage
    rolls until the start of your next turn.  Additionally, once per
    round if you hit your target with a weapon attack on your turn you
    can immediately make a second attack with the same weapon against the
    same opponent.
  </p>
  <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level, your knowledge of your opponents weaknesses allows you to strike with
    uncanny precision if you catch them off guard.  Whenever you use your
    Know Your Enemy feature, and you have advantage on the attack roll or
    the opponent is adjacent to one of your allies, you can add
    2d6 damage to the attack roll, this increases to 3d6 at 14th level,
    and 4d6 at 18th level.  You can only add this bonus damage once per
    round, no matter how many attacks you make.
  </p>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Attack</h4>
  <p>
    At 17th level, when you use an inspiration point to add a bonus to
    your attack roll, you can attack twice as part of your attack action,
    adding your intelligence modifier to both attacks.
  </p>
  <h3>Arcane Dilettante</h3>
  <p>
    The Arcane Dilettante has studied magic enough that they begin to seem less like
    their faking it, and more like a practiced wizard.  They no longer rely on bursts
    of inspiration for their most practiced spells, and can put together an idea of
    how to cast even unpracticed spells with minimal practice.
  </p>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    At 5th level, the number of inspiration points you need to cast a
    spell is reduced by one, to a minimum of 0 for cantrips.  Also you can
    cast an additional 2 spells per day (in addition to the amount listed
    in the Factotum table) before requiring a long rest.  Finally the
    highest level of spell you can cast increases by 1 over that listed in
    the Factotum table.
  </p>
  <h4>Additional Skill Proficiency</h4>
  <p>
    At 5th level the arcane dilettante gains proficiency in the arcana skill.  If they were already proficient in the
    arcana skill they gain expertise in the arcana skill (can add their proficiency bonus twice).
  </p>
  <h4>Spell Study</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level you have become a proficient enough spell
    caster that you can make a spell work with only minimal study.
    Starting when they gain this feature, the Factotum can add any spell
    they successfully observe being cast to a a spell journal.  In order to successfully add it to their spell journal the following conditions
    must be met:
    <ul>
      <li>The spell must be of a level the Factotum can cast.</li>
      <li>
        The Factotum must be able to see(if it has somatic/material components) and hear(if it has a verbal component)
        the spell being cast.
      </li>
      <li>
        They then must succeed on an intelligence(arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + the spells level at the time the spell is cast.
        If they fail this check they can try again only if they observe the spell being cast again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>    
      The Factotum can, in addition to their normal spells known, prepare 1 spell from their spell journal.  Whenever you regain your spent
      inspiration points you can change what spell you have prepared.
    </p>
  </p>
  <h4>Sage</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 17th level you regain your spells per day after short rest
    instead of a long rest.  Also the highest level of spell you can learn
    and cast increases by an additional 1 level over that listed in the
    Factotum table (combined with the additional level from Improved
    Inspired Spellcasting, your maximum spell level increases by 2, to 7).
