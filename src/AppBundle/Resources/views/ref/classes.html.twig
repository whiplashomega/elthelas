  <h2>Factotum</h2>
  <p>
    The Factotum is the ultimate seeker of knowledge.  A student of
    all schools, the Factotum seeks any kind of knowledge, and uses everything
    she learns to her advantage.  Her constant study allows the Factotum to
    display flashes of inspiration, filling any role necessary, if only for
    a short time.  The Factotum is nothing if not versatile, although
    occasionally unfocused.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above all, the Factotum is prepared for anything, any circumstance and any challenge, at least when
    they manage to make it out of the library.  While the Factotum's focus on learning new things is
    similar to the wizard's focus on arcane knowledge, the Factotum does not share the Wizard's focus.
    The Factotum is just as interested in that tome on arcane combat styles, or the architects detailed
    schematics as that previously unknown spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Factotum's as civilians often work as librarians, scientists, or advisors to people of power.  As adventurers
    they travel the world seeking out stores of hidden knowledge, documenting unusual creatures, learning from reclusive
    masters of various arts and skills, or just meeting unusual people, enjoying foods they could never experience at home,
    and seeing the sights.  In all of their doings they have a talent for coming up with the solution no one else thought of,
    and with a flash of inspiration, snatching victory and success from the jaws of failure and defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans and half-elves are the most common factotums, followed by halflings
    and gnomes.

  <h4>Inspiration</h4>
  <p>
    The Factotum gets a number of inspiration points that they can spend to
    activate certain class features.  They get inspiration points equal to
    their intelligence modifier plus half their class level(rounded down),
    minimum 1.  They recover all of their inspiration points when they
    finish a short rest.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Skills</h4>
  <p>
    You can spend an inspiration point when making any skill check to add
    your intelligence bonus to the check.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 1st level, you can spend inspiration points to cast
    spells.  You know cantrips and spells according to the factotum
    table, and can learn any spell from any classes spell list as long as
    you are able to learn spells of that level.  Intelligence is your
    spellcasting stat for these spells.  You can cast a cantrip as long as
    you have an inspiration point to spend on it, and a spell of a higher
    level as long as you have sufficient inspiration points to cast it,
    and a spell slot remaining.  Casting a spell costs a number of
    inspiration points equal to 1 + the spells level.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 2nd level, you can spend an inspiration point before
    making an attack roll to add your intelligence bonus to the attack
    roll.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Damage</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action you can spend an inspiration
    point to add 1d8 to any weapon or spell damage roll you make until
    the start of your next turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Factotum Philosophy</h4
  <p>
    At 3rd level your studies begin to focus on a particular specialty.
    Choose one of the Factotum Philosophies below, you gain different
    abilities depending on which philosophy you choose.  You gain
    additional philosophy features at 10th and 17th level.
  </p>
  <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
  <p>
    At 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you gain a +2 bonus to one ability score, +1 to two ability scores, or a feat.
  </p>
  <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
  <p>
    At 5th level you can make 2 attacks when you take the attack action on your turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Action</h4>
  <p>
    At 11th level, On your turn you can spend 3 inspiration points to get
    an extra action.  You can only do this once per long rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    At 13th level, when you use the inspired damage feature you add 2d8 to
    your damage rolls.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Reaction</h4>
  <p>
    At 14th level, when you have the opportunity to react to an action but
    have already reacted that turn you can spend 2 inspiration points to
    react a second time.  After you do this you cannot use this feature or
    the inspired action feature until the end of your next turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Recovery</h4>
  <p>
    At 20th level you no longer require a short rest to regain your
    inspiration points, but can do so by spending 10 minutes reading and
    studying your books and materials.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Factotum Philosophies</h3>
  
  
  <h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    Those who follow the Brains over Brawn philosophy have focused their studies on the weaknesses
    of their potential enemies, taking the idea of knowledge as power into the field of combat. These
    scholars always seem to know their enemies weaknesses, and can use that knowledge to get around
    their defenses.
  </p>
  <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can spend a bonus action to study an
    opponent and discover how to get past its defenses.   When you use
    this ability pick a target, you can use your intelligence modifier
    instead of strength or dexterity on weapon attack rolls and damage
    rolls until the start of your next turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 7th level, your knowledge of your opponents weaknesses allows you to strike with
    uncanny precision if you catch them off guard.  Once per round, when you successfully hit an opponent with an attack and that enemy
    is adjacent to an ally or you have advantage against them, you can
    spend 1 inspiration point to add 2d6 damage to the attack roll, this increases to 3d6 at 11th level,
    4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.
  </p>
  <h4>Fighting Style Mimic</h4>
  <p>
    At 10th level the Brains over Brawn Factotum can pick one of the following fighting styles.  Whenever they finish a long rest they can
    spend 3 inspiration points to replace this fighting style with a different one from the list.  This ability does not stack with the fighting
    style granted by any other class.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Archery</strong> - You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
    <li><strong>Dueling</strong> - When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
        with that weapon.</li>
    <li><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage
        of the second attack.</li>
    <li><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
        make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
        roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
        this benefit.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Attack</h4>
  <p>
    At 15th level, when you use an inspiration point to add a bonus to
    your attack roll, you can make an additional attack as a bonus action,
    adding your intelligence modifier to both attacks.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Arcane Dilettante</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    The Arcane Dilettante has studied magic enough that they begin to seem less like
    their faking it, and more like a practiced wizard.  They no longer rely on bursts
    of inspiration for their most practiced spells, and can put together an idea of
    how to cast even unpracticed spells with less effort.
  </p>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    At 3rd level, the number of inspiration points you need to cast a
    spell is reduced by one, to a minimum of 0 for cantrips.  Also you can
    cast an additional 2 spells per day (in addition to the amount listed
    in the Factotum table) before requiring a long rest, and can cast higher level spells, use the table below instead of the Factotum table to determine
    the highest level of spell you can cast and your spells known.

  <h4>Additional Skill Proficiency</h4>
  <p>
    At 3rd level the arcane dilettante gains proficiency in the arcana skill.  If they were already proficient in the
    arcana skill they gain expertise in the arcana skill (can add their proficiency bonus twice).
  </p>
  <h4>Spell Study</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 7th level you have become a proficient enough spell
    caster that you can make a spell work with only minimal study.
    Starting when they gain this feature, the Factotum can add any spell
    they successfully observe being cast to a a spell journal.  In order to successfully add it to their spell journal the following conditions
    must be met:
    <ul>
      <li>The spell must be of a level the Factotum can cast.</li>
      <li>
        The Factotum must be able to see(if it has somatic/material components) and hear(if it has a verbal component)
        the spell being cast.
      </li>
      <li>
        They then must succeed on an intelligence(arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + the spells level at the time the spell is cast.
        If they fail this check they can try again only if they observe the spell being cast again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>    
      The Factotum can, in addition to their normal spells known, prepare 1 spell from their spell journal.  Whenever you regain your spent
      inspiration points you can change what spell you have prepared.
    </p>
  </p>
  <h4>Cantrip Master</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level, whenever The Factotum finishes a long rest they can trade out one cantrip you know for a different cantrip that they have
    successfully recorded to their spell journal.
  </p>
  <h4>Sage</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 15th level you regain your spells per day after a short rest
    instead of a long rest.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Chameleon</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    The Chameleon focuses his studies on taking on any roll in society, to the point of literally being other people.
  </p>
  <h4>Additional Skill Proficiency</h4>
  <p>
    At level 3, when you take this philosophy, the factotum becomes proficient in the deception skill and with disguise
    kits if they are not already proficient.
  </p>
  <h4>Everday Illusions</h4>
  <p>
    At level 3, when you take this philosophy, the factotum learns the minor illusion cantrip in addition to their normal
    cantrips known, and can cast it without spending an inspiration point.
  </p>
  <h4>Hide in the Crowd</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to disappear into a crowd.
    Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
    to hide by standing within 5 feet of 2 or more other humanoid creatures.
    You gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)
    checks as long as you remain within 5 feet of at least 2 other humanoid creatures.
    If you take an action besides hide, your camouflage is revealed to the creatures you are with
    as well as anyone actively searching for you.  If you are discovered you cannot
    attempt this action again for 1 minute.  This bonus does not stack with other bonuses to
    Dexterity (Stealth) magical or otherwise.
  </p>
  <h4>Imposter</h4>
  <p>
    At 7th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic
    another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.
    You must spend at least three hours studying
    these three components of the person’s behavior,
    listening to speech, examining handwriting, and
    observing mannerisms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a
    wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have
    advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make
    to avoid detection.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you spend an additional day and 10gp worth of materials
    you can also assemble the perfect disguise that when donned
    allows you to be indiscernible from your target to the casual
    observer.
  </p>
  <h4>Disguise Self</h4>
  <p>
    At 7th level you learn the spell Disguise Self if you do not already know it,
    and can cast it once per day without spending inspiration points or a spell slot.
  </p>
  <h4>Master of Deception</h4>
  <p>
    At 15th level you add your intelligence bonus to all stealth and deception
    checks.  If you spend an inspiration point on a stealth or deception check
    you instead add double your intelligence bonus.
  </p>
  <h4>Major Image</h4>
  <p>
    At 15th level you also learn the spell Major Image if you do not already know it,
    and can cast it once per day without spending inspiration points or a spell slot.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>The Skill Monkey</h3>
  
  
  <p> The Skill Monkey has made it their mission to master every skill, taking the Factotum's philosophy of prepared for anything.</p>
  <h4>Jack-of-all-Trades</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can add half your proficiency
    bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that
    doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.
  </p>

  <h4>Improved Inspired Skills</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 7th level, when the Skill Monkey uses the inspire skill ability they add their proficiency bonus as well as their intelligence modifier
    to the check, even if they are already proficient in that skill.
  </p>
  <h4>Expertise</h4>
  <p>
    At 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
    proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
    make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
  </p>
  <h4>Reliable Talent</h4>
  <p>
    By 15th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
    they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
    check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
    treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
  </p>
