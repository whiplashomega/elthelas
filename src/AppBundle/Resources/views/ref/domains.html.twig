  	<h2>Divine Domains</h2>
<p>
    In a pantheon, every diety has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a diety's domain.  All
    the domains over which a diety has influence are called the diety's portfolio.  For example, the portfolio of the greek god
    Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light.  As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your diety's portfolio to
    emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.
</p>
<p>
    Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your diety.  Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one
    region as Phoebus ("radiant") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo
    A cesius ("healing"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply
    be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.
</p>
<p>
    Each domain's description gives examples of deities
who have influence over that domain.

<h3>Knowledge Domain</h3>
<p>
The gods of knowledge-including Oghma, Boccob,
Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth-value learning and
understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is
to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities,
or promote the practical knowledge of craft and
invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its
secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers
that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the
secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study
esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret
places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods
of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft
and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx,
Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.

creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the
creature's mind to command it.
</p>
<p>
	As an action, choose one creature that you can see
within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until
you finish a long rest.
</p>
<p>
	If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its
current emotions and what it is actively thinking
about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts
for 1 minute.
</p>
<p>
	During that time, you can use your action to end this

	Starting at 8th level, you add your W isdom modifier to
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a
number of minutes equal to your W isdom score and
must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
were casting a spell.
</p>
<p>
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Object Reading.</strong> Holding an object as you meditate,
you can see visions of the object's previous owner.
After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner
acquired and lost the object, as w ell as the most recent
significant event involving the object and that owner.
If the object w as owned by another creature in the
recent past (within a number of days equal to your
Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute
for each owner to learn the same information about
that creature.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Area Reading.</strong> As you meditate, you see visions
of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
going back a number of days equal to your W isdom
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
one significant event, beginning with the most recent.
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,
births and funerals. However, they might also include
more mundane events that are nevertheless important
in your current situation.
</p>
<h3>Life Domain</h3>
<p>
	The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive
energy-one of the fundamental forces of the universe-
that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality
and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of
death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
influence over this domain, particularly agricultural
deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun
gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal,
Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and
community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

<h4>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h4>
<p>
	Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to heal the badly injured.
</p>
<p>
	As an action, you present your holy symbol and
evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit
points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any
creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit

to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't
use this feature on an undead or a construct.
</p>
<h4>Blessed Healer</h4>
<p>
	Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st

increases to 2d8.
</p>
<h4>Supreme Healing</h4>

creature, you restore 12.
</p>
<h3>Light Domain</h3>
<p>
	Gods of light promote the ideals of rebirth and
renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the
symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed
as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes
pierce every shadow and see through every deception.
Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that
art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a
god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance
and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged
with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded
is immune to this feature.

your W isdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

	Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing
radiant damage to your foes.
</p>
<p>
	As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any
magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled.
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of
you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level
on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature that has total cover from you
is not affected.
</p>

throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.
</p>
<h3>Nature Domain</h3>
<p>
	Gods of nature are as varied as the natural w orld
itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to
friendly deities associated with particular springs and
groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a
whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing
mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in
their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have
clerics as well, champions who take a more active role
in advancing the interests of a particular nature god.
These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that
despoil the w oodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful,
or wither the crops of those w ho anger their gods.

creatures you designate.
</p>
<h4>Dampen Elements</h4>

of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of
violence, physical strength, and courage. In some
pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities
and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts.
In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this
domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors.

propitiation to w ard off divine wrath.

underground or indoors.
</p>
<h3>Trickery Domain</h3>
<p>
	Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand
as a constant challenge to the accepted order among
both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves,
scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their
clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing
pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing
captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than
direct confrontation.

<h3>War Domain</h3>
<p>
	War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of
ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with
acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of
excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great
deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring
others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence
as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor
and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage and gods of
conquest and domination. Other w ar gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war
in all its manifestations and supporting w arriors in any
circumstance.
