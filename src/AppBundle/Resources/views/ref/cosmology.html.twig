	<h2>Planar Cosmology</h2>
		<p>
		The Planes in Elthelas are geographically coexistent, but the actual matter making them up is seperated by barriers of arcane
		force.  Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them.  Since cutting through
		multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent
		planes, usually the astral plane.
		</p>
      <h2>The Central Planes</h2>
        <h3>Elthelas - The Material Plane</h3>
        <p>
            The material plane sits at the confluence of the other planes, and exists as the primary creation.  The material plane behaves
            as one expects, obeying the standard laws of physics outside of magical intervention.  Gaian keeps her home on the material plane,
            the only God who is permitted by the rules of the Gods Agreement to manifest on the material plane physically, simply because she has
            no other home.
        </p>
        <h3>Ethereal Plane</h3>
        <p>
            The Ethereal Plane is less a plane on it's own, and exists more as the space between the planes.
        </p>
        <h3>Astral Plane</h3>
        <p>
            The home of dreams and thoughts. Home of Maris.
        </p>
        <h3>Shadowfell</h3>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Feywild</h3>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h3>Dragon Eyrie</h3>
        <p>
          Home of Bahamut and Tiamat
        </p>
      <h2>The Inner Planes</h2>
        <h3>Plane of Air</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Plane of Water</h3>
        <p>
            Home of Trimala
        </p>
        <h3>Plane of Fire</h3>
        <p>
            Home of Molton
        </p>
        <h3>Plane of Earth</h3>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h3>Negative and Positive Energy Planes</h3>
        <p>
          Divine energy can be split into two forces, negative and positive energy.  These forces on their own can be used to produce magical effects,
          and are used by clerics for many purposes.  The combination of these energies into a precise mix is the source of consciousness and life.
        </p>
        <h4>Positive Energy Plane</h4>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h4>Negative Energy Plane</h4>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h4>The Confluence</h4>
        <p>
          The point where the positive and negative energy planes come together is known as the confluence.  At this point sits an imposing palace
          of white and black stone, the home of the Goddess Nera.
