  <h2>Aasimar</h2>
  <p>
    Aasimar are the distant descendents of angels and gods. In Elthelas, there are 3 main subgroups of Aasimar, there is the standard Celestial Aasimar, descended
    from angels, planetars, guardinals, or eladrin. There are the descendents of Molton, god of fire and lust, who bears many children with his mortal worshippers.
    Lastly, there are the descendents of the sorceron, who have long since disappeared from the world, but whose mastery over magic lives in in their distant
    descendents.
  </p>
  <h3>Celestial Aasimar</h3> 
  <p>
    Celestial Aasimar are the descendents of the children of unions between good-aligned celestial beings such as angels, planetars, guardinals and eladrin with
    mortal men and women. Celestial Aasimar were once quite common in Elthelas but they have grown increasingly rare in the ages since the God's War, as Celestials
    have largely abandoned Elthelas. Celestials walked the world in that distant age and bred with the various peoples in it. Now Celestial Aasimar mostly appear
    when two families with old Aasimar blood come together.

      6th Sense: Your connection to angelic beings gives you a sense for evil, like an itch at the back of your mind. Whenever someone within 60 ft of you is planning
      an evil deed to happen within the next 10 minutes, you can sense that such thoughts are taking place. However, you cannot tell who is thinking said thoughts or
      what they are planning from this sense alone. You do not need to be able to see or perceive the person thinking those thoughts to get the sense, and you do not
      get these feelings from creatures with an intelligence score of less than 3.

  <h3>Child of Molton</h3>
  <p>
    Molton, God of Fire and Lust, has long made it a habit of dallying with mortal women from among his worshippers. Those willing worshippers whom he selects are
    invited across the planes into his palace, where they report on returning having the best sex of their lives, returning with enough riches to set them and the
    resulting child up for the rest of their lives. His fertility knows no bounds, and even the most infertile women have found themselves with child after such
    encounters. The resulting children are usually still mostly human (and usually female, although not always), but find themselves infused with the essence of
    fire. They are reknowned for their lustful ways(sometimes unfairly) as well as their affinity for fire, music, and dance. Children of Molton look mostly like
    their mothers parentage, but are born with hair in bright fiery colors of red, orange, yellow, blue or green and golden skin. They are also invariably
    beautiful, their skin without unnatural blemishes, faces well balanced, and a form that is lithe and graceful.

    the Sorceron were a race of Godly servants that served all Gods. Originally serving the Gods in creating the world Elthelas and the many interconnecting planes
    of existence in an age long since forgotten. In the Gods War they served on both sides, and were the primary combatants, and while most of them died in that
    conflict, some few survivors retreating to other planes of existence besides the material with the Gods. Yet, before that age many Sorceron interbred with the
    races of Elthelas, and every now and then a child will be born with more Sorceron blood than typical. These unusual children show a rare talent for magic and
    are gifted with intelligence and charisma far beyond that of their kin.

    <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
    <p>
      After the people of Dera were rescued by the Dragon God Bahamut, many dragons came to live among the people of Dera'Dragorim, and it became a matter of honor
      to bear the child of a dragon. While half-dragon children were rarely viable, those that were born proved to be incredibly fertile, and it was considered
      almost as great an honor to bear the child of a half-dragon as a dragon. This led to a large population of people with a quarter or less of dragon blood,
      called Dragonborn or Spellscales. Dragonborn are more draconic in appearance than their spellscale cousins, are larger, and considerably stronger. They have
      scaly hides, draconic like faces, and often have clawed hands and feet or even wings. Outside of Dera'Dragorim and more urban settings, they are often seen
      as monsters.

Dwarves
The Dwarves suffered a difficult split at the end of God's War, one large group of them found themselves abandoned on a chain of islands, while the biggest group was in the center of the large easter continent, Elathia, and under constant attack by orcs and trolls. Since then those trapped on the islands have become the most adept sailors in the world, finding safety and wealth on the sea. The others have found homes in both mountains and plains, and have formed a caste-based republic.
This has split the dwarves into 4 distinct sub-races, that although they are capable of interbreeding, rarely do.

Deep Dwarves
The Deep Dwarves are the ruling caste of dwarven society in Curinor. They rarely(if ever in their lives) see the sun, preferring to stay in the deepest parts of the dwarven holds. They travel between holds via underground roads or by palenquin, and almost never associate with plains dwarves, let alone non-dwarves. Deep Dwarves have exceedingly pale, almost colorless skin.

Dwarven Combat Training: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and warhammer.

Noble Blood: You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice choosing from persuasion, performance, intimidation, or deception.

Hill Dwarves
The Hill Dwarves of Curinor are the middle glue of society. Most dwarven craftsmen and warriors are hill dwarves, and they do most of the work in the lucrative mines and smithies of Curinor (although the deep dwarves still see most of the profits). Hill Dwarves are hardy folk, but are ill-accustomed to dealing with non-dwarves. Their skin is fair, but not pale, typically with rose colored undertones.

Morrind Dwarves
The Morrind Dwarves were seperated from the other dwarves in the God's War, and marooned on a distant island chain. They built a city in which they could remember their mountain home(called Morrind) and learned to build ocean worthy ships. They took to the sea, trading with whomever they could find in order to supply themselves with whatever they needed. By the time they found the other dwarves, they discovered that they were more comfortable at sea then on land, and unwelcome in the caste-system devised by their kin. Morrind dwarves tend to be less hardy but more dextrous compared to their kin, and are very adept at shipboard movement.

Plains Dwarves
Plains Dwarves are the lowest of the low among the dwarves of Curionr. Living primarily on the surface, they are often shunned by other dwarves, however they are more accustomed to interacting with other races, as well as hard manual labor. Nevertheless, they are typically poor and ill-educated. Their life on the open plain has endowed them with a dark tan tone to their skin (particularly compared to the pale deep dwarves).

Elves
The elves were the first race to recover after the climactic God's War. The Gods and Sorceron did not see the mostly feral elves of the ancient world as reliable soldiers and Sylvan, their patron Goddess went to considerable effort to protect her people from harm. However once the war was over, with the other races having highly reduced and scattered populations, the elves finally got around to building cities and expanding. They formed the nation of Eldoran, which remains probably the most powerful nation on the planet besides Malinval. However, the high elves have often proven arrogant, and their internal conflicts with the moon elves finally resulted in cival war. The Moon Elves successfully asserted their independence and formed the nation of Demal Thor.
The Elves are split into 4 distinct subraces, the city dwelling high elves, the rural wood elves, the nomadic moon elves, and the still feral wild elves.

High Elves
The High Elves make up the majority of the ruling and merchant class of elves in Eldoran, and are the primary residents in the cities. They are relatively few compared to the Wood Elves who live throughout the countryside, but because most elven merchants are high elves, they tend to be considered the most stereotypical. High Elves are somewhat weaker, but better educated then Wood Elves.

Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
Cantrip: You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Extra Language: You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

Moon Elves
The Moon Elves of Demal Thor are a hardier breed of elves than the High Elves or Wood Elves, but they are gruff loners who generally appear standoffish to those outside of their clan. They live in nomadic clans of between 2 and 3 hundred individuals that wander the plains following the herds.

The Faelin have no written language and thus no recorded history, their reclusive nature means they are mentioned only in passing in the texts of other peoples.

Fey'ri
At the time of the demon invasion, Dera was home to the largest elven community outside of Eldoran. Unfortunately for these elves, their community was among the first attacked by the demons. Throughout most of the world it is believed that all of the elves were slaughtered, however a small percentage were kept as slaves, serving the whims of their demon masters, and subject to their lusts. Many of them died birthing the demonic offspring of these unions, and those who did not were rendered infertile. When Bahamut turned his wrath on the demons, forcing them to flee, they left their slaves, and their offspring, behind. These elves, trapped between an angry God and demon slavemasters, hid in the sewers of the ruined city, where they have lived since, expanding them as they had need of space. Over time they have intermarried and the demonic blood has spread and become diluted throughout their people. Today they rarely leave their underground home, but ocassionally one will leave to travel the world. They are typically mistaken for a pointy eared , skinny and winged tiefling, and they rarely find a welcoming reception. Most return home.
Fey'ri have a naturally evil disposition, and the society as a whole has largely given into the call of their blood. The underworks of Dera where they live is a harsh environment where only the strongest are permitted to survive.

Gnomes
The gnomes are a small, hardy folk, usually around 3 feet tall, but broad of shoulder with large featured faces (particularly their noses). Unlike halflings, who look like miniature humans with hairy feet, gnomes bodies are thicker and more dominated by the torso(although not to the extent of dwarves). The gnomes of Elthelas are split people. The eastern, Elathian Gnomes live in small reclusive communes within the cities of others, primarily the humans of Dormania, Kandor, and Gerasalim. Once they had a nation of their own, but it was destroyed and burned to the ground by the Emperor Dorman I, all record of it purged from history in the following years. Meanwhile in the west the gnomes of Stagenheim have become masters of technology.

Elathian Gnomes
The imperial gnomes are natural tricksters and illusionists, adept at surviving as the bottom rung of society. They tend to prefer city life and the excitement it brings over the quiet countryside.

Not that others are typically interested in their mountain home. The Stagen people are lovers of technology above all else, and moreso, they are craetor of technology and magical items without peer. The designs for their fabled airships are jealously guarded, as is the design and construction of their magical crystals, immune to antimagic effects, and with limitless charges. Those outsiders who know of them often claim that the crystals are the result of the gnomes directly tapping the power of Gods, but such rumors are probably unfounded.

Goblins are small gangly humanoids between 3-3 1/2 feet of height, they have skin ranging in color from an olive brown to a verdant green, smashed upturned noses, and large ears similar to those of elves. Their limbs, particularly their arms, are long compared to their torso, and they often grow large amounts of body hair. Most Goblins in the world are tribal, cruel, and generally bullies wherever they can be. Nevertheless most goblins live their lives as slaves to orcs and hobgoblins. Goblins are unusually strong for their size, having about the srength of the average adult human in a body less than half that size. Their small size and gangly form makes them very nimble as well, nevertheless they are typically considered ugly and have a perpetually sour disposition.

Goliaths
Goliaths are a tall, gangly, rocky skinned and tribal people. They love sport and competition, and are exceptionally strong and hardy. Their incredible height, strength, and large limbs allow them to weild weapons and perform feats of strength much better than most creatures of a relatively similar size. The Goliaths of Elthelas live in wandering tribes in high mountainous areas. They have never formed any centralized nation, and there have never been enough of them for any existing nation to try to force them under the national banner. The largest concentrations of Goliath tribes live in Stagenheim and Curinor, and they trade regularly with the local gnomes and dwarves respectively.

Half-Dwarves
The rare offspring of a dwarf and a human, Half-Dwarves look like thick, powerful somewhat shorter than average humans or very tall, somewhat gangly dwarves. While they are almost unheard of in most lands, there is a small but vibrant community of half-dwarves in the border region between Curinor and Gerasalim.

Half-Elves
Half-Elves are incredibly rare in most of the world, but in the eastern areas of Eldoran and southwest Gerasalim, where elves and humans have lived side by side for generations, it sometimes seems as if every other person is a half-elf.

Halflings
Halflings are small, gentle folk, who look almost like half-scale models of humans(except for their large hairy feet.) They are found almost everywhere and among every people, although their numbers dwindle as you grow closer to major war zones. They live in the cities, as well as building villages of their own in more remote locations, and try to profit however they can. They enjoy good food and good humor, and few halflings seek adventure. There are two different varieties of halflings in the world, as well the 'tallfellows', descendents of halflings who have interbred with humans or elves. The Lightfoot halflings predominate in Elathia, while the Strongheart Halflings are more common in Atyrea.

Lightfoot Halflings
Lightfoot halflings tend to be happy-go-lucky sorts. They are most prevalent on the eastern continent of Elathia, where they live among the humans, elves, and dwarves primarily, with some small communities in orcish cities of the south. Lightfoot halflings are more slight of build compared to their cousins the Strongheart halflings.

Tallfellow halflings are the descendents of halflings and humans or halflings and elves. Considerably taller than your typical halfling (averaging between 4 1/2 and 5 feet) they are still considerably shorter than humans and most elves. Nevertheless they are able to weild human sized weapons, and ride full size mounts. They also make bigger targets.
Tallfellow halflings are rare, but are more common in more cosmopolitan cities. In more rural halfling communities they are often outcast as half-breeds, while in human and elven communities they are looked down on for their small stature.

They were saved from annihilation by the Dragon God Bahamut and relocated to a chain of islands off the coast, where the founded the nation of Dera'Dragorim.

Over the course of their slavery they were exposed to repeated compulsion spells, and over time built up a resistence to such effects. This resistence manifests itself in person as an incredible strength of will (what some would just call stubbornness). They also have a great tradition of horsemanship and herding, particularly in Hisru'de'tan where it is their entire way of life.

Imperial Humans
The imperials are descended from the scattered human nations on the eastern continent that were eventually united under the Dormanian Empire. Although the empire has since split into the nations of Gerasalim, Kandor, and Dormania, movement of people and continuous trade has resulted in a shared culture and heritage. Before the empire, the 15-odd nations that dotted the human portions of the continent each had their own rich and varied history, much of which was lost or destroyed when Emperor Dorman the 1st led his soldiers in conquest. Only the most studied of scholars today knows anything of the history of the varied parts of the empire before then.

Neran Humans
The Neran people descend from the old kingdom of Nerim, once a great player in world politics, and the center of Nera's cult. After the magical disaster that left over 90% of the population as roaming, mindless undead, those who remained fled north and west, taking up residence where they could, in lands that now make up the nations of Terron, Arad, Seran, and Shendarel. Their history has left this people changed in oddly contradictory ways. Having been touched by the Death Goddess herself, they are naturally skilled at necromancy, but highly distrustful of those who use such magic. This touch also often makes them sickly. Their history of warfare with the undead has forced their clerics to train more than others in the art of channelling energy to turn undead, and their warriors more skilled at fighting them. Their natural distrust of others makes them poor diplomats, but they also have an unusual ability to recognize and avoid evil.

Staelic Humans
Often forgotten by the rest of the world outside of their immediate neighbors, the Staelic people inhabit the merchant kingdom of Alfadir, as well as their ancestral homeland of Staelia. They are masters of combat in medium and heavy armor, as well as tactical and mounted combat, and have developed an inherent resistence to the cold southern lands of their home. Historically their growth as a people has been checked by the endless war between them and the trolls, giants, and ogres who regularly sweep down from the Gorgro Plateau, and the strange and varied ice monsters that sweep northward from the ice wastes.

Orcs
Orcs are primarily characterized by their great strength. They are slightly taller than humans, and much more muscular, with green to mottled brown skin, large noses, a prominant brow-ridge and an underbite featuring tusks. While they are stereotyped as being stupid, evil, and cruel, only the last 2 are usually true. They are also the most populous race in the world save humans, and had they the same room to expand, they probably would have outbred humans long ago.
Orcs are also generally tribal, and orcish society revolves around rule by the strongest. Unfortunately this does not lead to stable societies, but rather warlords who rise and fall, usually within a few years, and who war amongst themselves. These warlords are generally High Orcs, a breed that has long seperated itself from their kin, favoring skill in leadership or sorcerous magic over pure brute strength. Far to the south, in Nerim, the Sand Orc tribes roam.

Grunt Orcs
The grunt orcs have never really been able to rule themselves in any organized or permanent manner. When they haven't been ruled by outsiders or their high orc brethren, they have generally been little more than tribal, ruled by whatever warlord happened to be the strongest. Grunt Orcs are the strongest of the orc breeds, and make up the bulk of the orc armies. When not at war they often compete in feats of strength, including blood sports.

Blood Scent: When an opponent is reduced to half or fewer hitpoints, the scent of the blood can send you into a sort of frenzy. Attacks against foes with half or fewer hit points do an extra 2 damage.

High Orcs
The high orcs are less strong, and slightly smaller than grunt orcs, and more than a bit lazy, but they make up for it with greater social skills and diplomatic nature. They tend to be the rulers in Orc society, playing others off each other to rise to the top in orcish politics, befriending the strongest grunt orcs, and using them as champions as they rise to the top of society. Many of the high orcs live apart from their kin, on the island nation of Olda, where they keep vast hordes of slaves to do their bidding, watched over by highly paid mercenaries.

Sand Orcs
The Sand Orcs are an offshoot of Grunt Orcs that have taken up a nomadic lifestyle in the deserts of Nerim. They are a hardy people, and excellent riders, making use of powerful riding lizards for travel. They move from oasis to oasis in wandering tribes, and have little contact with the outside world.
Sand Orcs are leaner compared to their Grunt Orc and High Orc cousins, and their skin more brown and tan than green.

Tieflings
Tieflings are the descendents of humans that have mated with demons or devils, they bear the mark of this touch in their appearance and nature. They often bear demonic traits, such as horns, forked tails or tongue, or reddish skin or eyes. They also tend towards evil more than the average person, and although this is far from a given, it is common enough that the distrust that follows them everywhere is justified.
Tieflings are not quite as rare as Aasimar (given demons' proclivity for lust), although they are still rare enough to cause a stir in any town they show up in, especially given their heritage. Tieflings are more common in the west, where demons, and demon attacks, are also more common. Tieflings of a good or neutral persuasion can usually find shelter in Dera'Dragorim or Zelfir, the second as a service to Amathera as a pity of their natural plight, and the first in recognition of a shared victimization at the hands of aggressive demon invaders.

Trollkin
Oft described by those who meet them as 'damn ugly, but damn efficient killers', trollkin are gangly, thick chested humanoids with disgustingly angular faces, long pointed noses, and grey-green to brown skin. Strong and hardy, they are somewhat larger than an orc, and have clawed hands.
The trollkin were originally craeted during the dawning years of the world as a magical experiment in interracial breeding. The end result was something akin to a fast maturing, highly stunted troll, and was cast out by its Sorceron creators as a failure and released into the wild. Yet the trollkin's improved intellect in comparison to their troll progenitors, ability to breed quickly, and fit into other societies (with a bit of care and luck), enabled the Trollkin to thrive where trolls were hunted and killed. During the God's War, the trollkin were conscripted as foot soldiers into the armies of every side, and by the end of the war, only a few hundred remained alive. Nevertheless, these few hundred managed to find a land of their own on a large island that they named Degak'Ta, and from there they have spread out to various lands once again.
The trollkin, unlike every other major race on Elthelas, are naturally antitheistic. They generally feel the Gods betrayed their people in the God's War, using them as pawns, sending them to their deaths, and in the end, providing no reward. Politically, they tend to discount charisma as useless, rewarding strength and cunning. In their homeland of Degak'Ta they are ruled by a warlord, who gains office through contests of strength and tactics. In foreign affairs they are generally aloof, not taking sides in conflicts as a people, and instead hire out individually or in small groups as mercenaries to either or any side, and they are highly valued as such.
