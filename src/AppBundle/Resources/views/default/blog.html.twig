  <h2>Elthelas Blogroll</h2>
  <div class="blogentry">
    <h3 class="blogtitle">It begins!</h3>
    <h4 class="blogdate">11/6/2015</h4>
    <p>
      This isn't a real blog yet, but it will be!  Soon I will create the RSS feed, and then from there this will host a description
      of changes I've made to the site over time.  As for todays changes? I added this of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also I pushed a bunch of changes to
      the geography page, mostly filling in content, as well as starting on a change to the nations overlay to include colorations on
      the map to show zones of control.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that I added the beginnings of non-player race descriptions to the races page, I've got buttons for a bunch of them,
      but so far only descriptions and racial traits for bugbears and gnolls.  They are based on the monster manual entries, but
      I took some liberty in interpretation. <span class="bg-danger">NOTE: These races are NOT for use by player characters. Not
      only did I make NO attempt at balancing them with other player races, but the two I've filled out so far would probably be
      attacked on sight in any civilized city or town.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Expect more work on these things in the coming days/weeks.  Most of the cities don't have descriptions on the geo page yet, so
      that alone will be hours of work for me.
    </p>
