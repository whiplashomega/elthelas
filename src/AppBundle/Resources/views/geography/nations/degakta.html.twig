				military regiments.  The ultimate ruler is the grand marshal, however his primary
				responsibilities are the approval of large scale mercenary contracts and the appointment
				of the generals.

				<strong>History: </strong> The Trollkin were an experimental half-breed race that came
				about during the God's War.  They were discarded as too weak as compared to their troll
				forebears and were thus left to their own devices.  They found a place for themselves on
				the island of Degak'Ta, and despite the poor opinion of them held by the Sorceron who
				had created them, the Trollkin are exceptionally disciplined and capable fighters.  The
				Trollkin have built the wealth of their country on their value as mercenaries, and most
				every major war has involved trollkin mercenaries on one or both sides.

				<strong>Gods: </strong>

			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Degak'Ta is officially non-theistic to avoid conflicts
				of interest
				with potential employers.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> Degak'Ta sees a lot of cultural imports, but the
				primary culture consistently remains Spartan and militaristic in nature.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Trollkin do not have many merchants or much of a merchant
				marine, particularly for an island nation.  They do, however, have a sizable navy that
				transports their mercenaries to where they are needed.  Trollkin mercenaries send most
				of the money they earn home to support their families back in Degak'Ta.

			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> Slavery is not strictly illegal in Degak'Ta, but the
				Trollkin do not keep slaves themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> Those who are capable mages are encouraged to pursue the craft
				for military purposes, and their is a small warmage college in Sunra.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong> Any citizen can hold property in Degak'Ta as long as it is
				within the disgnated area apportioned for their regiment.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Anyone can join the mercenary bands of Degak'Ta, and 2
				years of honorable service earns citizenship in Degak'Ta.  Because they are so accepting
				of capable soldiers that may not be accepted elsewhere, there is actually a sizable
				minority of ogres who have emigrated to the island over the years, as well as a few
				full-blooded trolls.
