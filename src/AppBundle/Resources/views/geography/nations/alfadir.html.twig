				<strong>Government: </strong> Alfadir is a country that can be bought.  The primary government in Alfadir is the
				Council of Lords, however titles are not hereditary or elected, but rather purchased, as an optional, and very
				significant, tax.  Once a title is paid for it lasts 10 years unless the tax is paid again.  Thus the wealthiest
				members of society make the rules, and outside forces sometimes make large inroads into Alfadiran society through
				the influx of money.  Indeed there are 3 members of the council who are in fact Morrind Dwarves, and 2 from Staelia,
				1 from Hisru'de'tan, 2 from Zelfir, 5 from Dera'Dragorim, and 6 from Stagenheim.  There is no limit to the number of
				lords that sit on the council, and the funds raised by the tax go to civic improvements and the maintenance of the
				army, often through generous no-bid contracts to council members.

				<strong>History: </strong> Alfadir was originally a Staelic colony by a group of merchants who hoped to escape the
				endless wars with the trolls.  It worked, and the colonies position on two major rivers that come out of the
				gnome-controlled mountains of stagenheim means that there are a bevy of goods to carry to the coast.  Additionally,
				Alfadiran merchants handle most of the purchase and sales of Hisru cattle to lands that need it, such as Zelfir and
				Stagenheim, and control the ports in the villages that line the isthmus between Zelfir and Hisru'de'tan, and in the
				Hisru city of Atyrao.

				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> Alfadir is a country where anything can be bought for the right price, even things
				that are nominally illegal can usually be obtained if one has the money to pay for a title first.  Corruption is
				rampant, and it is simply expected that obtaining government services will require a bribe of some sort.  The poor
				tend to keep their heads down and work their land.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Alfadir's economy revolves around the river trade and cash crop farming within the
				fertile flood plains of its rivers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the land in Alfadir is owned by the very wealthy, who rent out portions of it to poorer farmers rather
				than work it themselves.  Cash crops such as cotton and dyes are common more inland, while the coastal region is
				the worlds largest producer of sugar.

				public roadways can be bought.

				is treated the same way, and always based on the size of their wallet.
