				<strong>Government: </strong> Arad is a monotheistic theocracy that
				worships <a href="/gods/nera.php">Nera</a>, Goddess of death and rebirth.
				Their government is led by her Prophet who has led the country since the
				demise of Nerim, although it is rumored that he is looking to die soon.

			<p>
				<strong>Ruler[s]: </strong> The Prophet Albeliath
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>History: </strong> Arad was already a colony of
				Nerim at the time of the cataclysm, however the
				church there was largely disconnected from that on the subcontinent.  For
				years prior to the fateful day that ended the Empire, the priests in
				Arad had told of the corruption of the church and warned that the
				Emperor's quest for immortality was against the teachings of Nera.

				<strong>Gods: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nera</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship: </strong> Nera is the only God worshipped in
				Arad, if not by law then by practice.  They consider themselves the true
				followers of Nera and that the church of Nerim at the time of the
				cataclysm was corrupt and misinterpreting her words, particularly the
				emperor who thought to be immortal, for while Nera may grant long life to
				her most faithful subjects, all beings must die so that their souls may
				be reborn.  There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the beliefs
				of the people of Arad, and many nations have severed diplomatic relations
				with them fearing that they will cause another cataclysm.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> The people of Arad are very formal, and
				always polite.  They take for granted the appearance of certain things
				that others would consider horrible or disconcerting, such as the
				presence of deathless (which few outside of Arad can distinguish from
				typical undead) and faithful clerics who are approaching 3 or even 4
				hundred years of age.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Arad is primarily agrarian, with many
				orchards and wineries.  They export fine wines and artisan cheeses as
				well as dried fruits such as prunes and apricots.
			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> While the people of Arad do not keep slaves,
				slavery is allowed by treaty with <a href="malinval.php">Malinval</a>
				that also keeps the orcs from invading.  People who have not traveled to
				Arad often believe that they keep undead slaves to do all of their work.
				The fact is that undead in the typical sense are very rare in Arad, and
				are hunted down.  Rather deathless, who come back to aid their families
				by choice, appear quite commonly, particularly if they were devout
				followers of Nera.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> Arcane magic is not illegal in any way, but most
				people in Arad see it as inferior to divine blessing.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong>Property in Arad is owned by families and
				passed from generation to generation.  Family estates tend to grow as
				families expand, rather than children move away.  When two people are
				married, the man generally moves in with the woman's family.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Only followers of Nera are granted
				citizenship in Arad.
