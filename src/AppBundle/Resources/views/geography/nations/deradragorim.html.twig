				<strong>Government: </strong> Dera'Dragorim is ruled by the Dragon Emperor, an Elder Gold Dragon who has grown
				accustomed to human form, and who was put in place by Bahamut to rule justly and protect the people.  There have
				been rumors that the Dragon Emperor is aging and may soon die, as he has become increasingly reclusive over the last
				dozen years or so.

				<strong>Ruler[s]: </strong> The Dragon Emperor Valraxa

				<strong>History: </strong> The islands that make up Dera'Dragorim used to be only distant colonies of the mighty
				empire of Dera.  Dera ruled nearly half of the continent from their mighty capitol near the eastern coast of Riftlan.
				Yet it would not last.  It is not known whether it was the work of some powerful evil wizard or simply a random rift
				as opens on that continent from time to time, but a portal opened one day high in the mountains above Dera between
				this world and the endless abyss.  It was not long before hordes of demons began to pour through the portal.  They
				marched relentlessly out of the portal in ever greater numbers.  Whenever they found human habitation they would
				murder the men and children, burn everything to the ground, rape those women they desired, and send them onward to
				tell the tale.  It was not long before the horde stood at the gates of Dera itself.  Those people who had not
				already fled were slaughtered.  It was just after the burning of the great city that Bahamut intervened.  The Dragon
				God led the metallic dragons from all over the world against the demon horde and drove them back.  Finally closing
				the portal through which they had come.  Those demons that survived fled to the western mountains where many remain
				to this day.  Bahamut brought the survivors of Dera to Vasha and Vashna, then small towns and left one of his
				greatest warriors to rule over them.  They renamed their land Dera'Dragorim in honor of the sacrifice the dragons
				gave for them and took up the worship of Bahamut.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then Dera'Dragorim has grown in wealth and prosperity.  They have become great traders, rivaled only by the
				Morrindim and monopolize much of the trade in the west.  Their warm fertile islands produce a variety of goods and
				they have even reestablished colonies on the continent, the largest being the city of Portsmith.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Gods: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bahamut</li>
				<li>Maris</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Dragons of all kinds are considered holy in Dera'Dragorim although metallic
				dragons in particular.  Bahamut is the patron God of the empire and his temples are everywhere. Yet they owe much of
				their wealth to trade and Maris the God of trade has a significant following in the trade enclaves.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> There are many unusual halfbreeds who find welcome in Dera'Dragorim including
				dragonborn, tieflings, mephlings, and genasi.  This is a representation both of their history, and of the highly
				tolerant nature of their society.  Science and magic prosper, and Vashna holds the only alchemists guild outside of
				Stagenheim.  Dragons are not only culturally sacred but militarily important to Dera'Dragorim as they make use of
				many draconic beasts as both mounts and war machines.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Dera'Dragorim's economy is based on cash crops which produce multiple times a year (as
				the tropical climate allows for growing crops year round) and trade.  They export silk, citrus, spices, rice, and
				exotic animals and carry many other goods from one country to another.
