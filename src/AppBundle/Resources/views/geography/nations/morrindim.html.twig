				<strong>Government: </strong> The Nation of Morrindim is a republic governed by the council of captains. With a
				grand admiral who acts as a high judge. Matters on board a ship are handled by the captain as absolute ruler. The
				council of captains is made up of all the captains in the Morrindim fleet, in total something like 5000 souls.

				<strong>History: </strong> After the God's War a small group of dwarves found themselves marooned on an island far
				away from any other land. Over time they developed ships and took to the sea seeking other dwarves, however, by the
				time they did they found that they had adapted to the sea as most dwarves to their mountain homes. Since then the
				Morrindim have been generally neutral in wars (although they have had a few with Dera'Dragorim over trade rights)
				and generally trade peacefully with anyone. Including the orcish nations and others.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Gods: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maris</li>
				<li>Trimala</li>
				<li>Dorun</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Maris and Trimala have the largest cults in Morrind, relating to their extreme
				dependence on trade and the seas. However, they also pay service regularly to Dorun, the patron God of the dwarves.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> All of Morrind culture, even those on land, relates strongly to that of shipboard
				discipline. One obeys ones captain absolutely, and punishments tend to be severe. Loyalty is likewise strong among
				the Morrind. Morrind dwarves who live on land are still organized into 'ships' of 150-300 people who are commanded
				by a captain.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> the Morrind are highly dependent on trade for their welfare, however they do produce a
				few goods for export, including advanced ships and fine porcelain.
			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> Slavery is illegal among the Morrind, but respect for others customs and ways is common,
				and people with slaves who come on board a Morrind ship are respected.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> Magic is forbidden except by permission of the captain. Nevertheless most ships have a
				sorcerer or wizard on board.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong>Personal property is generally limited to what can be carried in a chest. Land, ships,
				and other large items are owned by the captains, however, profits from ventures are distributed strictly throughout
				the crew by law, where the captain gets 5% and the rest is divided evenly.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Anyone who is accepted into a ships crew is considered a citizen.
