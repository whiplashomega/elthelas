				<strong>Government: </strong> Curinor is ruled by the under-king, who is really more of a
				temporary elected president, as he serves a 5 year term and has greatly limited powers.
				The bulk of governing power lies with the Curin Congress, an assemblage of Deep Dwarves,
				elected by the deep dwarves of each hold.

				<strong>Ruler[s]: </strong> Under-King Magnor Stoneshield

				<strong>History: </strong> The dwarves found themselves in an unlikely place in Curinor.
				While the large mountain ranges made for excellent places in which to dig their holds,
				they were stuck with enemies on every side, with the human kingdoms on the east, the
				elves to the west, and the orcs to the south.  Nevertheless, for most of their history
				they have thrived reasonably well.  They subjugated the nearest human kingdoms to them,
				and used them to supply grain and other farm products to the holds while exporting metals
				and finished goods.  It was a good situation until Dorman I invaded the vassal kingdoms.
				He crushed the dwarven army, and even managed to capture a number of the small holds
				along the border of Curinor.  He even laid siege to <a href="/world/cities/curinkeep.php">Curin Keep</a> for several years before
				giving up.  The dwarves managed to maintain their sovereignty, but they have been in
				decline ever since, with their population shrinking and near-constant wars with the
				elves.  In recent years they have even lost any effective presence in the Mithril Hills,
				bringing an end to over 1000 years of conflict with Eldoran over those lands.  And
				clearing the way for both the Elves and Dwarves to join the Alliance of 6 Nations, and
				the construction of the Fortress of Light by Dwarven engineers.

				<strong>Gods: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dorun</li>
				<li>Amathera</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Dwarves are not a typically religious people, but they
				all revere Dorun, patron God of the Dwarves and Deep places. The poor plains dwarves
				often worship Amathera as well, entreating her for protection.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> Society in Curinor is caste based, depending on how
				deep in the mountains you and your ancestors lived.  Those dwarves that almost never see
				daylight, the Deep Dwarves, are the highest caste, and hold most of the political and
				economic power, while the Hill Dwarves that make up the bulk of the population live in
				the caves closer to the surface and regularly travel to trade with other peoples.
				Meanwhile the Plains Dwarves are farmers and craftsman that live on the open central
				plain of Curinor, and are shunned by most other dwarves.  The dwarf holds are huge cave
				systems built into mountains and deep in the earth.

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Curinor exports a wide variety of valuable minerals as well
				as stock metal.  They also export weapons, armor, fine metalwork crafts and coal

			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> Slavery is illegal, but many Plains Dwarves live in effective
				slavery due to their caste making it impossible for them to earn more than a subsistence
				wage.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> Licenses are required to practice magic in Curinor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong> Where one is able to purchase property depends on ones
				caste.  A Plains Dwarf is not permitted to purchase property within the holds, while a
				hill dwarf must purchase property within half a mile of the surface.  The Deep Dwarves
				are the only ones allowed to live and own property in the deep mines where the mineral
				veins are the richest, although they usually hire hill dwarves to do most of the actual
				work of mining.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Only deep dwarves hold any political power in Curinor,
				while the laws on the books nominally state that any dwarf (technically including the
				Morrindim) or half-dwarf is a citizen of Curinor.
