<h3>Black Wolf Irregulars</h3>
<p>
  The Black Wolf Irregulars are a mercenary organization that has existed in northern <a href="/geo/continents/elathia">Elathia</a>
  for the last 200 years or so, hiring themselves out by company to various
  militaries. They have a history of taking in those who don't fit into a standard military structure and coming up with unusual tactics designed to take advantage of
  them. After the formation of the <a href="/org/allianceof6nations">Alliance of 6 Nations</a> they were hired en masse by the same to be a
  cross-national force that worked strictly for the Alliance as a
  whole. The Irregulars typically work in small squads on the peripheries of major battles, handling scouting missions, infiltration missions, and other missions that
  require unusual or specialized training for a small number of individuals.

  Despite their reputation for success and loyalty to their contractors, they still tend to be distrusted by national professional militaries.
