		<a href="/geo/nations/gerasalim">Gerasalim</a>,
		<a href="/geo/nations/kandor">Kandor</a>, and
		<a href="/geo/nations/dormania">Dormania</a>, members of the Illustrious Guild of Merchants and
				Fine Artisans controls most of the trade throughout the region.  Operating a trading company without the blessing of the guild is
				generally considered to be unhealthy, often leading to premature death by such diverse means as poison, stabbing, falling from very
				high places, and lynching.

		governance, and a certain amount of protection from unwanted competitors, unless of course those competitors are also guild members.
