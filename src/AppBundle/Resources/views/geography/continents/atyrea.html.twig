<h4>Atyrea</h4>
<p>
  Atyrea is the southern most known continent in Elthelas. It is connected by land bridge to the continent of Riftlan. It contains 6 major nations, namely:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hisru'de'tan</li>
  <li>Sage</li>
  <li>Alfadir</li>
  <li>Stagenheim</li>
  <li>Staelia</li>
  <li>Gorgro</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Atyrea is the original home of the Staelic humans, a number of goliath tribes, and the Stagen gnomes. The hisru people migrated from Riftlan, displacing the
  native population in the northwestern plains, after a religious schism within their people. More recently orc colonists from Malinval carved a territory for
  themselves in the northeast, calling it sage.
