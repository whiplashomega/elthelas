	<h4>Mithril Hills</h4>
  <p>
		The Mithril Hills is a hilly trailless area along the border of Eldoran and Curinor rich in mithril and other valuable minerals. The two countries have disputed over ownership of the
    hills for centuries, and the wars typically only stopped when one side or both became involved in some other conflict. The end to the wars happened recently when the elves attacked the
    dwarven holds in the area while the armies were away elsewhere, slaughtering non-combatants and leaving them depopulated and empty. The dwarves fought the elves to a stalemate after that,
    but since the resulting peace treaty, the dwarves had had no active reason to declare war since.
