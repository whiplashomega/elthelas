	<h4>Sindi Ohta</h4>
  <p>
    Literally translated 'War River', Sindi Ohta was for many years the semi-official boundary between Eldoran and Curinor, with the dwarves controlling
    the Mithril Hills beyond.  As the elves continued to gain power and the dwarves military might slowly receded, the border pushed further and further to
    the north and east, beyond the river, until today it sits 50-100 miles beyond, running through the northern part of the mithril hills and terminating
    at the Fortress of Light, with the western part of the border changing from Eldoran to Demal Thor half way between.

    The land surrounding the river is sparsely populated, with the only settlement of any size being Storvel, a minor elvish city that sits astride the
    trade routes coming west from Gerasalim and Curinor.
