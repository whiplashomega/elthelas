	<h4>Titan's Peaks</h4>
  <p>
		The only act of major divine intervention to occur since the Gods' Agreement, the Titan's Peaks are actually a broad ring of mostly impassable mountains that circle what was once the
    subcontinent of Nerim. After the Nerim Cataclysm the Gods agreed that the undead needed to be stopped, and worked together to create the barrier.
