  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>
    The grand capitol, seat of the Dormanian Emperor, it is said that all roads lead to Desadorel.  The churches of Dorman and Alohim both house
    their central leadership in Desadorel.  Most of the cities population is poor, relying on handouts of food made by the government.  Meanwhile
    there is no place where politics is more ruthless than in Desadorel.  Assassinations, alliances, and deceit are the general order of business
    for Desadorel's upper crust.

    The city got its start as a agricultural and mining town, growing relatively rich off of deposits of copper, iron, and silver in the surrounding
    hillsides.  It was thrust into prominence by the greatest military leader to ever walk Elthelas, Dorman the First, who jockied his way from
    minor court functionary to the local King, to taking the thrown via coup de tat, and then a series of conquests that took his capitol from minor
    city-state to capitol of the world's largest empire.

    In the years that followed the city grew rapidly as people came from all over the known world to be close to Imperial power, by Dorman's death
    the city had grown from 5,000 strong to 50,000, and by the time of Dorman V, it contained nearly half a million souls.  The city has declined
    significantly since that peak, as Imperial power has wained, so too has the draw and influence of its capitol.
