	    Dera was once the capitol and largest city of a cosmopolitan human empire.  Today it is a ruin, reclaimed by the wilds, except for the sewers beneath the city, where the Fey'ri, the remains
	    of a local elven population interbred with the invading demons, live to this day.

	    The Fey'ri's existence is hardly common knowledge, although occassionally young Fey'ri will leave to find their place in the wider world.  To most of the world Dera is just an old decrepit ruin
	    that the Deran people often speak about reclaiming someday.
