<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  Ochre'ken is a relatively minor port city on the southern coast of <a href="/geo/nations/malinval">Malinval</a>.  Largely a resupply point for
  merchants headed further north and east, and a center of trade for the sparsely populated region of southwest Malinval.

  The city was recently attacked by demons, but managed to repulse the initial attacks, nevertheless the local population suffered significant losses
  due to the attack.
