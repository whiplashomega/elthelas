      Diya is a hub of the plantation economy of Olda, full of factories refining sugar and turning much of it into rum or molases, and others turning cotton into cloth.

      The city itself is a sprawling mess, with no strong government.  Powerful families of High Orcs build their factories and slave quarters in bunches, turning the city
      into what is more like a sprawling mass of towns of various sizes.  The duties of the city guard are farmed out to the retainers of the powerful families, and a 
      wanted man with one family might receive protection from another.
