<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Faran is the trade center of Arad, largely handling movement of goods between Arad and Malinval.  Like Albeliath, outsiders are welcome in Arad, unlike Albeliath, life does not revolve entirely around religion.
    While the people of Faran are still religious, and the Temple of Nera is still the official ruling body and important to everyday life, people worry much more about wealth and trade.
