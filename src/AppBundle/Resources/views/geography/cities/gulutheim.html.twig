  Gulutheim is a sprawling, and largely lawless, port city on the southern coast of <a href="/geo/nations/malinval">Malinval</a>.
  It's coast is largely protected from the rages of the oceans by the Isle of Peaks.  The local garrison is typically small, just enough
  to protect the interests of the warlord while the bulk of the armies fight the Alliance of 6 Nations to the north, and fend off any raids
  by the tribes on the Isle of Peaks.
