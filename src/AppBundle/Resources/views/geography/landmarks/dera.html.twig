  <h4>Dera</h4>
  <p>
    Once the capital of the Deran empire, now an ancient ruin destroyed by demons.  Yet it is not uninhabited.
    Underground, in the deep sewers, live the Fey'ri, a bastard race of elves and demons.  The spawn of the inhabitants
    of the first towns to be destroyed by the demons.
