  <h4>Abyssal Gate of Dera</h4>
  <p>
    High in the mountains above the ruined city of Dera, the abyssal gate that brought ruin to an empire is buried,
    now closed by Bahamut and guarded constantly by ancient silver dragons, the gate's location is marked by a constant
    smell of brimstone, and a complete lack of growing things.
