				<strong>Government: </strong> The king's authority in Seran is absolute. And he works through an appointed
				bureaucracy that handles most day-to-day issues.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Ruler[s]: </strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>History: </strong> Seran is the only remaining bastion of human habitation on the sub-continent that once
				was the center of power for the Nerimese Empire. The population consists of those who refused to give up their homes
				and flee in the face of the advancing armies of undead. The kings are the descendants of a powerful pair of heroes
				who rallied the people to defend themselves, saving a remnant of the people.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Gods: </strong> Cora
			</p>
			<ul>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> The worship of Nera is strictly prohibited in Seran, and occasionally those
				suspected of worshiping the Death Goddess are lynched, stoned, or otherwise killed rather than being brought before
				a magistrate. The locals mostly worship Cora the Crusader, who blessed them in their last ditch defense of their
				homes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> Seran has a large standing army under the command of the king. Unlike most
				embattled nations, the Seranites place such great honor in defending ones homeland that the army is strictly on a
				volunteer basis, and those who join quickly become professional soldiers. Meanwhile Kimly has a large merchant
				class, and sends out the most trade ships per capita of any human nation.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Seran is largely uninhabited outside of gathered settlements, and the area immediately
				around Kimly.  Food is mostly imported from Terron or Dormania.  The woods in Seran however are known for their
				hardwoods, and unlike the elves, they don't feel any misgivings about cutting down trees beyond conservation of
				economic potential.  While there are ample minerals, including very valuable veins of adamantine, mithril, and diamond
				in the Titan's Peaks, they go largely untouched, as building a mine in mountains filled with roaming undead armies
				generally leads to a quick death.  The few mines that exist are highly fortified and employ large numbers of
				mercenaries.
			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> Slavery is illegal and few slaves remain slaves when they come there.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> There is a small school of wizardry in Kimly, but Necromancy is never taught and is
				strictly prohibited on pain of death.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong> All citizens in Seran are permitted to own property, however, the king has the right to
				confiscate any property necessary for the defense of the state.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Anyone who maintains a residence in Seran is considered a citizen (and is thus
				subject to taxation).
