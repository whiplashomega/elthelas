				<strong>History: </strong> Stagenheim started out as a haven for gnome mages with unusual
				ideas in a network of caves provided to them by the God Tock. Over time they managed to
				overcome their various opponents and conquered a small nation of dwarves, as well as
				subdued several kobold tribes. When they managed to expand to the edge of Alfadir, their
				population exploded as they were able to import large quantities of food and other raw
				materials from throughout the continent.

			<p>
				<strong>Gods: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tock</li>
				<li>Fanome</li>
				<li>Molton</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> The priests of Tock are wealthy supporters of the many
				technologists in the country, and are in turn supported by those inventors who make it
				big with their support. Meanwhile the priests of Fanome serve as the emotional core of
				the country, as the single independent country of gnomish people. Molton is primarily
				worshiped by the people in the eastern Fire Islands who give offerings in the hope of
				avoiding his wrath in the form of volcanic eruptions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> The Stagen gnomes are technologists to the core, and
				strange contraptions both mundane and magical are common throughout Stagenheim.

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Economics:</strong> Stagenheim is a huge consumer of raw materials, and an
				exporter of all sorts of finished contraptions, magical devices, furniture, and metal
				goods.

			</p>
			<h3>Laws and Regulations</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Slavery: </strong> Slavery is illegal, and foreigners who have slaves often have
				them 'liberated' by the local authorities.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Magic: </strong> Magic use requires a license that can be revoked if the ability
				is misused, but the licenses are cheap, oversight limited, and rules lax.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Property: </strong> While physical property is generally well-enforced, special
				distinctions have to be made for depth and purpose of use.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Citizenship: </strong> Only gnomes have voting rights in Stagenheim.
