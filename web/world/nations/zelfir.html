				<strong>Government: </strong> Three archmagi serve as judges and make executive
				decisions by majority vote. They are elected by the council of wizards, a legislative
				body of 23 arcane casters elected by arcanists residing within 22 political districts 
				plus one extra appointed by the high priest of Amathera.  Elections for archmage are
				done proportionally, where the top 3 candidates get a seat. Local districts are ruled by
				a district governor appointed by the archmagi, and serving at their pleasure. Similarly
				the archmagi serve until a majority of the council votes to replace them or they lose
				their seat in that council. Council members serve a maximum of three 6-year terms. The
				voting eligible population consists of approximately 10,000 arcanists with a registered
				residence and license to practice magic within the country.

				<strong>History: </strong> At the time of the compact of Gods, only a few of the
				Sorceron people remained on Elthelas, most of them having either died in the war, or
				retreated to other planes of existence. One of those, whose name has been lost to
				history, maintained a kingdom of slaves to serve his every whim in the south of the
				western continent. Some of his slaves he trained in wizardry to provide additional
				conveniences. This proved his undoing. Some hundreds of years after the compact, these
				wizards, having managed to shake off the compulsion of their master, divined a method to
				imprison him. They lured him away from the kingdom, and their cast a spell that entrapped
				him forever with only the few slaves he had brought with him within an impenetrable
				magical barrier. However, when they returned to the city they found that their fellow
				slaves were confused, and did not know what to do. So they elected from amongst
				themselves rulers to guide the nation.

			<p>
				Zelfir has traditionally been a peaceful nation, although there occasionally have been
				wars with outside forces from Hisru'de'tan and Alfadir, and once a war with Dera that
				lasted for nearly a dozen years. Most of the army's time is spent hunting down stray
				beasts that wander south from the veldt.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Gods: </strong> Amathera
			</p>
			<ul>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Amathera is worshiped with monotheistic zeal, and is
				considered the liberator and protector of their people, to the point of her high priest
				selecting the only seat in the governing council filled by appointment. Her temples in
				Zelfir tend to be lavish, while the priests themselves live as paupers, giving donations
				to the temple to the poor.

				mine iron and other minerals.
