				<strong>History: </strong> Gorgro featured prominently in the development of nearby nations, as many of the
				creatures that call the high plateau home are difficult to deal with, to say the least. Tribes of giants and trolls
				can eat entire villages before men can be marshaled to defense, and Ogres, Trollkin, Gnolls, and Hobgoblins are
				certainly not threats to sneeze at. However, no one has ever really recorded any history of the denizens of the
				plateau itself.

			<p>
				<strong>Typical Worship:</strong> Worship methods vary significantly by the tribe and race. However Trolka and Malik
				are certainly the most common Gods worshipped.

				<strong>Magic: </strong> Particular moods on magic vary by tribe, but generally trolls, gnolls, and ogres are highly
				distrustful (or just too stupid to use it), while hobgoblins, giants and trollkin make use of it to their own
				advantage when they can.
