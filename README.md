# Elthelas Campaign Setting
A symfony2 website where I host all of the information related to my D&D campaign setting.

##Branches
Production releases are tracked on the 'production' branch.

Updates that do not require significant testing (such as introducing new content) are done on the master branch.

New features and significant code changes are done on the 2.0dev branch, when a new feature is ready it is merged into master and production.

Emergency fixes to broken or poorly tested code take place on the hotfix branch.
